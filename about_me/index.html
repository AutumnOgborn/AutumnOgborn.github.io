            <p>
                I am Autumn Ogborn. I am in 12th grade and have been at AAI for 3 years. I like to read, crochet, watch YouTube, use Linux, and generally do stuff with computers. I have a cat and a dog and I love them both very much. I really like frogs, mushrooms, chemistry, computers, and many other things. My favorite color is green. My favorite book series is the Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson. It is good and everyone should read it!
