            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I am Autumn Ogborn. I am in 12th grade and have been at AAI for 3 
                years. I like to read, crochet, watch YouTube, use Linux, and 
                generally do stuff with computers. I have a cat and a dog and I
                love them both very much. I really like frogs, mushrooms, 
                chemistry, computers, and many other things. My favorite color is
                green. My favorite book series is the Stormlight Archive by 
                Brandon Sanderson. It is good and everyone should read it!
            </p>
