                    In my project I will be learning how to hack. The main focus of my project will be on hacking webapps since this seems to require the least amount of experience and has way more information available about it. The goal of my project will be to learn enough about hacking to make consistent money from bug bounties and potentially even get a certification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose this project because I want to do hacking as my main job after I finish high school, and this seems like a good way to get started.
