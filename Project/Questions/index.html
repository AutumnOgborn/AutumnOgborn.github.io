                        <h5>What is an ethical hacker?</h5>
                        <p>
                            An ethical hacker is someone who uses hacking techniques to find vulnerabilities in the security of their target in order to help get those vulnerabilities fixed.
                        </p>

                        <h5>What are vulnerabilities?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Vulnerabilities are flaws in a computer system that can be used to perform unintended actions, usually with an impact on the security of the system.
                        </p>

                        <h5>What does an ethical hacker do day to day?</h5>
                        <p>
                            There are many activities that can be considered ethical hacking. One of these is hunting bug bounties. A bug bounty is a program in which a company allows anyone(with some exceptions) to attempt to find vulnerabilities on some or all of their public computer systems. When someone finds one of these bugs, they can get money from the company for reporting it. Another common ethical hacking activity is penetration testing. Penetration testing is when a company hires a hacker to test their systems, including private systems, for security vulnerabilities. These are the main ways that ethical hackers make money.
