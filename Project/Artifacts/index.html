                    <p>
                        This is the points I have on a CTF platform. I included this because it shows my learning on offensive security. For those who don't know, CTF's are challenges where you use real exploits on a simulated target in order to find a hidden string of text known as a flag. It is often performed as a competitive sport in hacking circles.

                    <p>One thing I did for my project was learn a variety of new programming languages. The one that I learned the most about was Rust, and the picture is of some of the code of my most recent rust project.</p>

                        This is the webpage that I designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I included this as an artifact because it shows how I learned various web technologies which will help me learn to exploit them later.

                    <p>This is the most important artifact of my project. It is the writeup of my entire project, focusing on skills learned and my favorite activity. It is more detailed than my project reflection, and more focused than my reflection essay.</p>
