                        This is the points I have on a CTF platform. I included this because it shows my learning on offensive security. For those who don't know, CTF's are challenges where you use real exploits on a simulated target in order to find a hidden string of text known as a flag. It is often performed as a competitive sport in hacking circles.

                        This is the webpage that I designed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I included this as an artifact because it shows how I learned various web technologies which will help me learn to exploit them later.

                        This was my first reverse-engineering project that I completed. Reverse-engineering is when you take an executable program and look at how it does what it does. This can be done to look for vulnerabilities within the machine code.

                        Portswigger Academy is Portswigger's online webapp hacking course. The image above is my stats on portswigger.

                        One of the main things that I learned during this project was Linux. This includes how to use Linux as an operating system, how to use the Linux command line, and how Linux works.
