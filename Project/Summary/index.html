                        My project was about learning to become a professional hacker, but that is not the kind of job that you can learn to do over the course of a school year. So, I instead focused on building skills that would serve me well once I eventually do gain all of the required experience and education to hack as a job. Throughout the Course of this project, I gained a lot of knowledge and skills, including:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Basic Linux command line skills</li>
                            <li>Javascript</li>
                            <li>HTML & CSS</li>
                            <li>Networking &rpar;both the computer and the people kind&lpar;</li>
                            <li>Nmap</li>
                            <li>Virtualization with VirtualBox and Xen</li>
                            <li>Security Best Practices</li>
                            <li>Burp Suite</li>
                            <li>And many other skills</li>
                        </ul> 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While all of these things will likely be extremely useful in my hacking career, there are some things that are hard to get from teaching yourself. This is why I am taking an Information Technology course at Mountainland Technical College. This will likely be an important step toward my eventual goals of becoming a professional hacker.
