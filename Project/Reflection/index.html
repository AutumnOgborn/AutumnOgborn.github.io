                        This project has been my favorite of all the Capstone projects that I have done at this school. My favorite part of this project was probably learning about various computer technologies and thinking about how one could exploit the design of those technologies for unintended behavior. This project mostly consisted of learning about computers, and the area that I did the best learning in was learning to use Linux effectivly. This is likely the most important thing that I learned while doing this project.

                        However, not everything in this project went smoothly. In fact, one thing that I was looking forward to doing initially ended up being a nightmare to actually perform. This was the process of installing Qubes OS, which is a extremely secure virtualized operating system. The process of installation itself wouldn't have been that bad if it wasn't for the fact that I ran into compatibility issues the whole way through. I eventually gave up on using it as my main operating system for this reason.

                        Overall, this project has been wonderful, and there is very little I would change. If there was to be one thing, I would probably have started out with more realistic goals which would have led to having more focus on things that I want to learn, rather than trying to force myself to learn something that would allow me to have a positive impact faster. This didn't have a huge effect on the project though, because in the end, this project turned out great.
